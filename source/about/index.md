# About

My name is Justin Wang. I'm from California. One of my greatest joys in life is creating things—products, experiences, visual identities—that are elegant and delightful.

Until recently, I designed and developed apps at Vertigo. Prior to that, I studied engineering at UC Berkeley, focusing on human-centered design.

I also enjoy music, taking [pictures](http://ihardlyknowher.com/justinjaywang), nature, playing sports, and cooking.

I'm currently looking for job opportunities doing digital product design.
