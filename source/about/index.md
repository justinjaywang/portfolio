# About

My name is Justin. I'm a designer from California. One of my greatest joys in life is creating things—products, experiences, visual identities—that are functionally and aesthetically elegant.

I recently designed and developed apps at [Vertigo](http://vertigo.com/). In the past, I also interned at [Duncan/Channon](http://www.duncanchannon.com/) and studied engineering at UC Berkeley, with a focus on human-centered design.
