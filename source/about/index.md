# About

I am a product designer from California. One of my greatest joys in life is creating things—products, experiences, visual identities—that are elegant and delightful. 

In the past, I designed and developed apps at [Vertigo](http://vertigo.com/) and studied engineering at UC Berkeley, focusing on human-centered design.

When I'm not designing or coding, I enjoy playing music, taking [pictures](http://ihardlyknowher.com/justinjaywang), playing sports, and cooking.
