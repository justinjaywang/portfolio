# About


I am Justin, a designer from California. One of my greatest joys in life is creating things—products, experiences, visual identities—that are elegant and delightful. I also like music, taking [pictures](http://ihardlyknowher.com/justinjaywang), nature, playing sports, and cooking.

Until recently, I designed and developed apps at [Vertigo](http://vertigo.com/). Prior to that, I studied engineering at [UC Berkeley](http://www.berkeley.edu/), focusing on human-centered design.
