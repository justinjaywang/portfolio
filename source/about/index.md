# About

My name is Justin. I'm a person, designer, and engineer in California. One of my greatest joys in life is creating things—products, experiences, visual identities—that are elegant and delightful. 

I recently designed and developed apps at [Vertigo](http://vertigo.com/). In the past, I also interned at [Duncan/Channon](http://www.duncanchannon.com/) and studied engineering at UC Berkeley, focusing on human-centered design.

I also love music, taking [pictures](http://ihardlyknowher.com/justinjaywang), playing sports, nature, and cooking.
