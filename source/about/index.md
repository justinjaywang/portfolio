# About

Hello, my name is Justin. I'm a designer in California. My favorite thing in the world is to create things—products, experiences, visual identities—that are elegant and delightful. The rest of my favorite things include music, taking [pictures](http://ihardlyknowher.com/justinjaywang), nature, playing sports, and cooking.

Until recently, I designed and developed apps at [Vertigo](http://vertigo.com/). I also interned in the [Duncan/Channon](http://www.duncanchannon.com/) Makers Program, a laboratory for new ideas. Back in 2012, I graduated with a BS/MS from [UC Berkeley](http://www.berkeley.edu/). I studied Mechanical Engineering, with a focus on human-centered design.
