# Collistive

<span class="lead-in">Collistive</span> is a website that crowdsources the most popular items in a list. People can vote items up or down, add items, and start new lists.

Built for a product development course at UC Berkeley in 2012, with Gene Pang, Genevieve Wang, and Edmund Ye. My role was in design and front-end development.
