<!-- ### Logos using the letters JJW -->
<!-- <img class="default" src="2014--2.svg" alt="" /> -->

Ever since I was little, I've loved sketching out logos. Especially ones with the letters of my initials. Ones I could use for my personal brand. I kid you not, I used to sign some of my artwork with it. Clever logos, with hidden symbols in the whitespace. It's like fitting pieces of a puzzle together.

As a project in the summer of 2011, I put a bunch into vector form in Illustrator. In 2014, I revived the project with new ideas and decided to continue to make logos. I find that, even with the restriction of using each of the letters, there are countless possibilities. Creativity is opened up by restriction.

Illustrator proficiency has gone up exponentially, especially using keyboard shortcuts all the time. Better at creating marks that are aesthetically pleasing. A lot of throwaways were decent, but missing the extra oomph from simply looking good.
