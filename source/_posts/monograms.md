# Monograms

Creating monograms has really been a lifelong project. I've been sketching weird symbols and logos based off my intials since as far back as I can remember. I even used to sign my artwork with whatever latest monogram I was into at the time.

Though restricted to the use of the three letterforms, *JJW*, there are limitless ways they can be arranged, interwoven, and manipulated to fit into a single graphic. Each monogram explores a different idea—negative space, shape, dimensionality—in one color, in order to be the simplest expression of that idea.

For this project, I've been inspired by corporate logos, baseball cap insignias, puzzles, math, and Japanese art motifs.
