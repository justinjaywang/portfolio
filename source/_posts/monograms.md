# Monograms

<span class="lead-in">Creating monograms</span> has really been a lifelong project for me. I've been sketching weird symbols and logos based off my intials since as far back as I can remember. I even signed my artwork with whichever latest monogram I was into at the time.

Though restricted to the letterforms, JJW, there are limitless ways they can be arranged, interwoven, and manipulated to fit into a single graphic. Each monogram explores a different idea, be it the use negative space, symmetry, shape, or dimensionality. They're depicted in one color in order to be the simplest expression of that idea.

For this project, I've been inspired by corporate logos, baseball cap insignias, puzzles, math, and Japanese art motifs.
