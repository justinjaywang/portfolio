# Monograms

Creating monograms has really been a lifelong project. I've been sketching weird symbols and logos based off my intials since as far back as I can remember. I even used to sign my artwork with whatever latest monogram I was into at the time.

Though restricted to the use of the three letterforms, there are limitless ways they can be arranged, interwoven, and manipulated to fit into a single graphic. Each monogram explores a different idea—negative space, shape, dimensionality—in a single color, in order to be the simplest expression of that idea.

I've been inspired by corporate logos, baseball cap insignias, puzzles, math, and Japanese art motifs.
