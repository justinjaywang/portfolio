# BARE

Established in 2007, [BARE Magazine](http://www.baremagazine.org/) is a student-run publication at UC Berkeley that focuses on fashion, lifestyle, and art. They produce a print magazine each semester as well as run the BARE Blog. In 2012, the editors approved a new logo and identity.

The rebrand was the result of BARE's expansion into the arts—food, music, and other culture—and was pushed for by the BARE layout design team (of which I was a part). Anything to replace what was reminiscent of the [Sears](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Sears_logo_2010-present.svg) wordmark.

The new logo has two versions: a stylized "B" and a full version with "BARE" across the bottom stroke.

The mark was designed with the ability to be used with a [variety](http://www.barestreetstyle.org/) of overlay textures. It also scales down well to icon applications, and is more instantly identifiable.

Since its adoption, the BARE logo has built up equity and recognition. It's been such a joy to see the brand grow. I love all the creative ways that succeeding generations of BARE designers have been utilizing the logo, and I'm excited to see what they'll come up with next.
