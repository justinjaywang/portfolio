# BARE

<span class="lead-in">[BARE Magazine](http://www.baremagazine.org/)</span> is a student-run publication at UC Berkeley that focuses on fashion, lifestyle, and art. They produce a print magazine each semester as well as run the BARE Blog. I was a member of their layout design team in 2012, when the editors approved a new logo and identity that I helped create.

The rebrand effort represented BARE's continued expansion into the artsâ€”food, music, and other culture. The new logo has two versions: (1) a stylized "B" emblem and (2) a full version with "BARE" across the bottom stroke.

The mark was designed with the ability to be used with a variety of overlay textures, as shown on their [Street Style blog](http://www.barestreetstyle.org/). It also scales down well to icon applications, and is more instantly identifiable.

Since its adoption, the logo has slowly built up equity and recognition, helping to grow BARE as a brand. With each coming year, new BARE designers are finding even more creative ways that they can utilize the logo. As its designer, it's been fun to see.
