# Griddler

<span class="lead-in">Griddler</span> is a word game for iOS and Android that was created to demonstrate the capabilities of [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/). The source code would later be published on GitHub to be used as reference for developers.

Given the parameters around gameplay, [Nina Nocetti](https://twitter.com/nibimono) and I created a comprehensive set of wireframes, visuals, and branding and worked closely with developers to get the designs implemented.
