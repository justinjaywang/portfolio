# Collistive

<!-- intro to class -->
In my last year at Berkeley, I got the opportunity to take

<!-- initial concepts -->

- crowdsourced checklists concept
- self-expression vs. utility

<!-- final prototype and launch -->

Collistive crowdsources the most popular items in a list. People can upvote or downvote items, add new items to an existing list, or start a new list. Launched in alpha in the spring of 2012, as a prototype for *Web-Based Product Development* at UC Berkeley.
