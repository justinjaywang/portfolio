They produce a print magazine each semester as well as run the BARE Blog. I was a member of their layout design team in 2012, when the editors approved a new logo and identity that I helped create.</p><p><img class="faded" src="old-logo.png" alt="Before"><br><img class="faded" src="new-logo-wide.svg" alt="After"></p><p>The rebrand effort represented BARE’s continued expansion into the arts—food, music, and other culture. The new logo has two versions: a stylized B and a full version with “BARE” across the bottom stroke.</p><p>The mark was designed with the ability to be used with a variety of overlay textures, as shown on their <a href="http://www.barestreetstyle.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">Street Style blog</a>. It also scales down well to icon applications, and is more instantly identifiable.</p><p><img class="default u-fillWidth" src="magazines.jpg" alt="The new BARE logo, on magazine covers"><br><img class="default u-fillWidth" src="flyers.jpg" alt="On advertising flyers"><br><img class="default u-fillWidth" src="stickers.jpg" alt="On stickers"></p><hr><p><span class="lead-in">Since its adoption</span>, the logo has built up equity and recognition, helping to grow BARE as a brand. As its designer, it’s been rewarding to see. Each year, succeeding classes of BARE designers are finding novel ways to utilize the logo, and I look forward to seeing what they’ll come up with next.</p></section></article></main><footer class="page-footer"><nav class="nav"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="nav-item"><a href="/" class="nav-link">Home</a></li></ul></nav></footer><script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.0.3/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/js/all.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">!function(e,a,t,n,c,o,s){e.GoogleAnalyticsObject=c,e[c]=e[c]||function(){(e[c].q=e[c].q||[]).push(arguments)},e[c].l=1*new Date,o=a.createElement(t),s=a.getElementsByTagName(t)[0],o.async=1,o.src=n,s.parentNode.insertBefore(o,s)}(window,document,"script","//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js","ga"),ga("create","UA-15132368-10","auto"),ga("send","pageview");</script></body></html>
