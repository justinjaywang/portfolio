They produce a print magazine each semester as well as run the BARE Blog. In 2012, the editors approved a new logo and identity.</p><p><img class="faded" src="old-logo.png" alt="Before"><br><img class="faded" src="new-logo-wide.svg" alt="After"></p><p>The rebrand was the result of BARE’s continued expansion into the arts—food, music, and other culture—and was pushed for by the BARE layout design team (of which I was a part). Anything to replace what was reminiscent of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Sears_logo_2010-present.svg" target="_blank" rel="external">Sears</a> wordmark.</p><p>The new logo has two versions: a stylized B and a full version with “BARE” across the bottom stroke.</p><p>The mark was designed with the ability to be used with a variety of overlay textures, as seen on their <a href="http://www.barestreetstyle.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">Street Style blog</a>. It also scales down well to icon applications, and is more instantly identifiable.</p><p><img class="default u-fillWidth" src="magazines.jpg" alt="The new logo, as seen on magazine covers. <span class='credit'>@baremagazine</span>"><br><img class="default u-fillWidth" src="flyers.jpg" alt="On advertising flyers. <span class='credit'>@baremagazine</span>"><br><img class="default u-fillWidth" src="poster.jpg" alt="On a poster. <span class='credit'>BARE Blog</span>"></p><hr><p>Since its adoption, the logo has built equity and recognition, helping to grow BARE as a brand. As its designer, it’s been fun to see. I’m inspired by all the creative ways that succeeding generations of BARE designers have been utilizing the logo, and I’m excited to see what they’ll come up with next.</p></section></article></main><footer class="page-footer"><nav class="nav"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="nav-item"><a href="/" class="nav-link">Home</a></li></ul></nav></footer><script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.0.3/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/js/all.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">!function(e,a,t,n,c,o,s){e.GoogleAnalyticsObject=c,e[c]=e[c]||function(){(e[c].q=e[c].q||[]).push(arguments)},e[c].l=1*new Date,o=a.createElement(t),s=a.getElementsByTagName(t)[0],o.async=1,o.src=n,s.parentNode.insertBefore(o,s)}(window,document,"script","//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js","ga"),ga("create","UA-15132368-10","auto"),ga("send","pageview");</script></body></html>
